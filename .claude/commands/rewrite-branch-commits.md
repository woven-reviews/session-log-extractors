description: Interactively rewrite commit messages for all commits on current branch

## Behavior

This command rewrites commit messages for all commits on your current branch
that differ from the repo's base branch. It uses an interactive process with
multiple confirmation points.

**Important:** This command rewrites git history. Only use on branches that
haven't been pushed, or that you're comfortable force-pushing.

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 0: Determine the Base Branch

- [ ] Run `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`. Fall back to `main` if that fails. Use this as `BASE_BRANCH` throughout.

### Step 1: Verify Rebase Status

- [ ] Ask: "Have you rebased from `$BASE_BRANCH`? This ensures we rewrite the
      correct commits. (yes/no)"
- [ ] If no: instruct to run `git rebase $BASE_BRANCH` first and exit
- [ ] If yes: proceed

### Step 2: Identify Commits to Rewrite

- [ ] Run `git log $BASE_BRANCH..HEAD --oneline` to get list of commits
- [ ] Display the list with: "These N commits will be reviewed for rewriting:"
- [ ] Show each commit hash and title
- [ ] Ask: "Proceed with reviewing these commits? (yes/no)"
- [ ] If no: exit
- [ ] If yes: proceed

### Step 3: Review and Rewrite Each Commit

For each commit (oldest to newest):

- [ ] Check out the commit temporarily: `git checkout {hash}`
- [ ] Display: "**Reviewing commit {n}/{total}: {short-hash}**"
- [ ] Show original commit message (title and body)
- [ ] Analyze changes using the commit-review process:
  - Read files changed and diff
  - Follow the three-pass writing process from the style guide
  - Generate improved commit message
- [ ] Display the proposed improved message
- [ ] Ask: "Action? (accept/skip/abort)"
  - **accept**: Use the improved message
  - **skip**: Keep the original message
  - **abort**: Stop the rewrite process and return to original branch
- [ ] Return to original branch: `git switch -`

### Step 4: Apply Rewrites

If any commits were accepted for rewriting:

- [ ] The shared commit-message policy bans interactive git commands (`-i`)
      because they need a human at a TUI — this command is the documented
      local exception, since rewriting history has no non-interactive
      equivalent. Do not use plain `git rebase -i`; instead run a
      non-interactive rebase with `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=: git rebase $BASE_BRANCH
      --exec '...'`.
- [ ] `--exec` runs its command after *every* replayed commit, not just the
      accepted ones, and original commit SHAs shift as soon as the first one
      is amended, so matching by SHA breaks after the first rewrite. Before
      starting the rebase, record each accepted commit's original subject
      line from Step 3. Then make the `--exec` command conditional: at each
      pause, compare the current commit's subject (`git log -1
      --format=%s`) against that recorded list — amend only on a match
      (using HEREDOC format, e.g. `git commit --amend -F- <<'EOF' ... EOF`),
      otherwise let the rebase continue with no change.

### Step 5: Summary

- [ ] Display summary:
  - Total commits reviewed: N
  - Commits rewritten: N
  - Commits skipped: N
- [ ] Run `git log $BASE_BRANCH..HEAD --oneline` to show final state
- [ ] Remind: "Branch history has been rewritten. Use
      `git push --force-with-lease` if already pushed."

## Commit Message Style

Follow the guidelines in @.claude/commands/shared/commit-message-style.md

## Key Requirements

- NEVER proceed without explicit user confirmation at each step
- NEVER force-push automatically - only remind the user
- If user aborts, return to original branch state
- Always use HEREDOC format for commit messages
- Display clear progress indicators (commit n/total)
